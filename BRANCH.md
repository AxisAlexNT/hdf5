# Architecture Documentation Branch

The purpose of this branch is to store work-in-progress architecture
documentation while it is being written. This documentation will live in
`doc/arch` (at least temporarily) and will probably NOT be in Doxygen format.


This branch can be deleted when the architecture documentation has been
merged back to develop
